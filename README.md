Fortinet Login Script for IIIT-Delhi
==================

A small script I made to log into the college Fortinet network

Put in your username at Line#8 and your password at Line#10 and just execute the script.

Make sure you have Python installed with the BeautifulSoup4 package.

You can obtain the BeautifulSoup4 plugin as mentioned here:

http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup

For both windows and linux, you can go on and download the tarball from http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/4.x/ (version 4.1.0 preferred) and just execute "python setup.py install" (make sure you are root) to install bs4.

No other dependencies other than BeautifulSoup4 as of now.
